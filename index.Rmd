## Why is Data analysis important in sport?

Within a sporting context, data-driven analysis is crucial when trying to broaden your knowledge of the game.

-   **Coaches** being able to identify which areas their team succeed at and what their opponents potential weaknesses are can give them a huge advantage when creating a game plan
-   **Analysts** can find relationships between stats and outcomes and provide an easier understanding as to why **point A** is a big reason for **point B** happening\
-   **Fans** can gain a greater understanding of why the team they support plays a certain way, or why **Player A** has certain strengths over **Player B**
-   **Media** can provide evidence-based commentary on team and player performance
